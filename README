Extend 2.0 is an evolution of [Extend 1.0](http://www.ivy.fr/extend/extend-1.0.0.js)
which implements a flexible class-based OOP layer on top of the JavaScript
prototype object model.

Extend 2.0 allows you to write nice and clean classes in JavaScript, features
introspection and class meta-information, is mature and
[fully-tested](http://www.ivy.fr/js/extend/test.html), and used as a base for
our wonderful [Sugar language](http://www.ivy.fr/sugar) runtime.

The problem
===========

  JavaScript being a prototype-based object language, it does not offer (in
  standard) a ''class-based'' OOP layer. This can become a problem when you're
  writing medium to large system, where prototypes start to be cumbersome to
  manage.

  The famous JavaScript [Prototype library](http://www.prototypejs.com)
  provides a very basic way to create classes, but does not provide any
  inheritance between classes.  Extensions such as [ExtendClass][2] and
  [ExtendClassFurther][3] tried to add sub-classing, but fail to have a
  flexible and reliable `super`-equivalent, which makes advanced JavaScript
  application development difficult.

  Moreover, neither of these extensions allow meta-information specification
  to classes (such as class name, methods, parent class, etc), while this
  information is very useful for debugging and introspection.

  Additionally, common cases such as handing an object method to a callback
  that may alter the 'this' is not supported ([jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)
  callback do that).

Introducing Extend
==================

  Extend 2.0 is a simplified, cleaner version of the Extend 1.X library, with
  the same design goals:

  - Traditional class-based OOP layer for JavaScript
  - Notion of class attributes (shared), methods and class methods (operations)
  - Introspection API to list attributes, methods, operations
  - Makes the difference between what is inherited and what is not inherited
  - Easy wrapping of object methods to be safely given as callbacks

  To start using 'Extend', simply add the following line to your HTML head
  section:

  >   <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.ivy.fr/extend/extend.js"></script>

  Once you've included the script, you can create classed by using the
  'Extend.Class' function:

  >   var A = Extend.Class({
  >     name:"A",
  >     methods:{
  >       helloWorld:function(){
  >         return "Hello, World !";
  >       }
  >     }
  >   });
  >   alert(new A().helloWorld());

  The 'Extend.Class' takes the following parameters, given in a dictionary:

  - 'name' (*required*): a string representing the class name. In case you want
    the class name to reflect a package hierarchy (like 'ui.widget.InputField'),
    you can use dots to join module names and class name.

  - 'parent': the parent class (if any) of this class.

  - 'initialize': the constructor function for this class.

  - 'properties': a dictionary mapping instance declaring attributes
    (properties) (and their optional default values).

  - 'methods': a dictionary mapping method names to functions implementing the
     methods, where the 'this' will refer to the current instance.

  - 'shared': a dictionary mapping class attributes names to values. Class
    attributes default values are inherited by sub-classes, and can be accessed
    directly (like 'A.foo' if 'foo' is a class attribute of 'A')

  - 'operations': a dictionary mapping class methods (operation) names to
     functions. The 'this' in these functions will refer to the class object, as
     returned by 'Extend.Class'.

  In methods, you 'this' will (obviously) point to the current instance. If you
  want to access the method 'foo' defined in class 'A', when you are in class
  'B' subclass of 'A', you can do:

  >   this.getSuper(A).foo()

  or use the faster option:

  >   this.A_foo()

  where 'A' is the name you gave to the class 'A'.


Extend API
==========

  Extend offers a set of methods that can are available to Extend classes and
  instances created from Extend classes. These methods range from simple
  introspection (what is the class of an object, what is this class name, is
  this an object an instance of this class, etc) to more complex things
  (safely wrapping a method for callback, listing inherited methods, etc).

  Extend API
  ----------

    'Extend.Class({...})'::
       Declares and returns a new class according to the class description
       given as argument. This description was explained in the previous
       section.

    'Extend.getClass(name:String)'::
       Returns the class with the given absolute name, if any.

    'Extend.getClasses()'::
       Returns a dictionary that maps _declared class names_ to actual class
       instances. Extend acts like a global namespace where non-anonymous
       declared classes are registered.

    'Extend.getChildrenOf(aClass)'::
       Returns a dictionary that maps _declared class names_ to actual class
       instances of classes that inherit from the given class ('aClass'). This
       excludes the given class from the result.

  Object API
  ----------

  The _object API_ defines the methods which are available to instances
  (objects) which were created (instantiated) from a class defined using Extend.

    'isClass()'::
      Tells if the given object is class or not. This returns 'false'

    'getClass()'::
      Returns the class object associated with this instance. You can use the
      class object to access class operations, class attributes, etc.

    'getMethod(name:String)'::
      In JavaScript, if you give a method as a callback by simply doing
      'object.method', then you may have problems when the caller changes the
      'this' argument of the method. Using 'getMethod' will ensure that the this
      is preserved. It's actually an equivalent of doing
      'this.getClass().bindMethod(this, name)', except that successive calls to
      'getMethod(...)' will always return the same function object, while
      'bindMethod' will create a new function each time (useful to know when
      you're using jQuery 'bind'/'unbind' functions).

    'getCallback(name:String)'::
      The 'getCallback' method is similar to 'getMethod', except that it will
      add an extra argument which is the 'this' used when invoking the method.
      Libraries such as [jQuery](<http://www.jquery.com>) change the 'this' of
      callbacks given to events such as 'click' or 'focus' to the DOM node that
      received the event rather than the instance to which  the method is bound.
      Using 'getMethod' insulates you from this change, but you also lose the
      reference to the DOM node that received the event (the event target). When
      using 'getCallback', you'll have the target as an additional argument.

    'getSuper(c:Class)'::
      Returns a proxy that will use the current object as state, but where every
      operation defined in the proxy will use the implementation defined in the
      given class.

    'isInstance(c:Class)'::
      Returns 'true' if this instance is an instance of the given class, which
      must be either the class of this instance, or an ancestor of this instance
      class.

  Class API
  ---------

  The _class API_ defines the methods which are available for class objects
  resulting from the use of the Extend API.

    'isClass()'::
      Tells if the given object is class or not. This returns 'true'

    'getName()'::
      Returns the class name, as given when creating the class.

    'getParent()'::
      Returns the parent class for this class, or 'undefined'.

    'hasInstance(o:Object)'::
      Tells if the given object is an instance of this class. This also includes
      the parent classes.

    'isSubclassOf(c:Class)'::
      Tells if this class is a subclass of the given class. This also takes into
      account the  parent classes.

    'listMethods(own:Boolean=True, inherited:Boolean=True)'::
      Returns a dictionary that maps methods names to unbound methods, including
      by default the 'own' methods and the 'inherited' methods. Settings these
      two parameters to either 'true' or 'false' will allow to return the
      desired subset.

    'listOperations(own:Boolean=True, inherited:Boolean=True)'::
      Same as 'listMethods', but with class operations.

    'listShared(own:Boolean=True, inherited:Boolean=True)'::
      Same as 'listMethods', but with class attributes (''shared'').

    'listProperties(own:Boolean=True, inherited:Boolean=True)'::
      Same as 'listMethods', but with instance attributes (''properties'').

    'getOperation(name:String)'::
      Returns the class operation with the given name wrapped so that the 'this'
      will be preserved even if you use 'operation.apply(other_object,
      arguments)' (pretty much like 'bindMethod').

    'bindMethod(o:Object, name:String)'::
      Returns the method named 'name' when it is bound to the given object. This
      method can be safely given as a callback, and even if the 'this' is
      changed in a 'method.apply(other_object, arguments)', it will be
      preserved.
      |
      However, it is good to note that 'bindMethod' creates a new function
      object each time you invoke it. So when you're using it with function such
      as jQuery 'bind'/'unbind' you'll have to make sure to keep a reference to
      your function.

    'proxyWithState(o:Object)'::
      Returns an object that will have the same operations and attributes
      defined in this class, but will use the given object as _state_ (as
      'this' or 'self'). Doing 'o getClass() getParent() proxyWithState(o)' is
      the equivalent of creating a 'super' keyword where you can invoke methods
      from the parent.

Examples
========

  Step 1: Create a new class

  >   var Shape = Extend.Class(
  >     name:"Shape",
  >     initialize:function(){
  >       this.points = [];
  >     }
  >     methods:{
  >       addPoint:function(p){
  >         this.points.push(p);
  >       }
  >       getPoints:function(){
  >         return this.points;
  >       }
  >     }
  >   });

  Step 2: Create an instance of your class, and do stuff

  >   my_shape = new Shape();
  >   my_shape.addPoint([0,0]);
  >   my_shape.addPoint([1,0]);
  >   console.log(my_shape.getPoints().toSource());

  Step 3: Create a subclass

  >   var Rectangle = Extend.Class(
  >     name:"Rectangle",
  >     parent:Shape,
  >     initialize:function(){
  >       this.points = [];
  >     }
  >     methods:{
  >       addPoint:function(p){
  >         this.points.push(p);
  >       }
  >       getPoints:function(){
  >         return this.points;
  >       }
  >     }
  >   });

  Using callbacks with jQuery

  >   var MyWidget = Extend.Class({
  >     name:"MyWidget",
  >     methods:{
  >       onClick:function(target){
  >         $(target).css({background:yello});
  >       }
  >   })
  >   
  >   var w = new MyWidget()
  >   $("#my-widget").click( w.getCallback("onClick") )
